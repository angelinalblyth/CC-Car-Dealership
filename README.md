CodeClan Cars
Model a car dealership (e.g. Arnold Clark), making sure to use the concepts that we've covered in Java as appropriate.

To start off with you should be working in a TDD fashion and creating tests for your classes. Make sure you plan effectively in preparation for the extensions.

MVP
Create different vehicle types
Assign them appropriate properties (e.g. price, colour, engine etc.)
Create classes for different components (e.g. engine, tyres) that can be used to compose a vehicle
Create classes for other components that a dealership might have (e.g. dealer, till, customer)

Extension
Allow a customer to buy a vehicle or book a rental vehicle
Allow dealership to buy vehicles
Allow dealership to repair vehicles
